# Overview

In engineering applications one often wants to simulate abrupt changes, such as turning on a light switch or kicking a can. At some level things actually behave continuously. But when they happen over a short time scale, it may be mathematically cleaner to treat the change as discontinuous without having a significant effect on the solution. (Compare this to how complicated Riemann sums are compared to integration by antiderivatives.)

We will encounter two types of abrupt changes: steps, which represent permanent changes in circumstances, and impulses, which represent momentary changes that have lasting effects.
