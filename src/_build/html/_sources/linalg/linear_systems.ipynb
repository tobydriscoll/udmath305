    "# Linear systems\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first learned algebra, there was a lot of focus on solving equations. It's very likely that you started with linear equations, because these are the easiest ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "## One variable\n",
    "\n",
    "It might feel silly, but let's review what it means to solve the linear equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ax = b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $a\\neq 0$, there is a unique solution, $x=b/a$.\n",
    "- Otherwise,\n",
    "   - If also $b=0$, then every value of $x$ is a valid solution.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, there are no solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, for nonzero $a$ there is exactly one solution, and otherwise, depending on $b$, there are either infinitely many or zero solutions. A linear system with no solutions is called {term}`inconsistent`, with the opposite being *consistent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to understand equations that depend linearly on multiple variables. But before even writing out what that means, let me give away the punch line: *the only possibilities are exactly the same three outcomes described above*. The main difference is that the condition \"$a=0$\" is modified to something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Going one more baby step to two equations in two variables, we want to solve\n",

    "cx + dy &= g.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some easy geometric intuition here. Each equation represents a straight line in the plane, and solving both equations simultaneously means finding an intersection of these lines. Our cases above translate directly into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the lines are not parallel, there is a unique solution.\n",
    "- Otherwise,\n",
    "   - If the lines are identical, there are infinitely many solutions.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, there are no solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not hard to turn those statements into algebraic conditions. The slopes of the two lines are (ignoring infinities for a moment) $-a/b$ and $-c/d$, and we can say the slopes are equal if and only if $ad=bc$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $ad\\neq bc$, there is a single solution.\n",
    "- Otherwise,\n",
    "   - If one equation is a multiple of the other, there are infinitely many solutions.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, there are no solutions.\n",

    "We identify $(a,b,c,d)=(1,-3,-2,6)$, and $ad-bc=6-6=0$. So we know there is not a unique solution (i.e., the lines are parallel). Dividing the second equation by $-2$ leads to the equivalent system\n",
