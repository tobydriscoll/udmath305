    "- In radioactivity it's common to use $t_h=-\\ln(2)/a$, which is the {term}`half-life`. That's because $\\exp(at_h)=1/2$, so half of the radioactive isotope is depleted in that much time.\n",
    "- Similarly, in population or another growth situation with $a > 0$, the time $t_D=\\ln(2)/a$ is the {term}`doubling time`. Note that populations and interest don't grow arithmetically over fixed time intervals, like in $1,2,3,4,\\ldots$, but geometrically, like $1,2,4,8,\\ldots$.\n",
