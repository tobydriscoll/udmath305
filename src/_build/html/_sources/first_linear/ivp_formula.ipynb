This can be called the **free response**, meaning free from external forcing. The other term is the **forced response** of the system, starting from a zero initial value.\n",

In fact, it's not much of a stretch to consider this formula a linear combination of free responses, just using a continuous coefficient function $f(s)$ rather than discrete coefficients! Finally, the complete solution to the IVP just adds the free response of the actual initial condition to the summed force responses. \n",
