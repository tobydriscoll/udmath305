We use these particular variables for theoretical discussion, but in practice the variables could be named anything. The term *first-order* indicates that only the first derivative appears and not $x''$, $x'''$, etc.\n",

    "A {term}`solution` to the ODE is a function $x(t)$ that makes {eq}`firstlin-ode` a true equation when inserted. Finding solutions usually takes some effort (and for most realistic problems it cannot be done at all). However, if someone proposes a solution to you, it's easy to check whether that is the case: substitute it into the ODE and manipulate it until you can ascertain whether the equation holds.\n",

    "A named quantity such as $a$ that is neither the independent nor the dependent variable is often called a {term}`parameter`. A parameter is assumed to be constant unless it is written, e.g., as $a(t)$ to show the dependence on $t$. A convention is to make parameters be positive where reasonable, a negative value would include an explicit sign such as in $-a$.\n",

But this particular ODE describes, for instance, the evolution of the slope of the line of sight to an airplane flying straight over you. When the airplane is directly overhead, the slope is infinite. So while the model becomes mathematically invalid at that moment, it does describe a concrete physical situation.\n",
