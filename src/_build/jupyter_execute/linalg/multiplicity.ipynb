    "Although we will mostly work with $2\\times 2$ matrices, eigenvalues are so important that it's worth getting to know more about the general case.\n",

    "## Characteristic polynomial\n",

    "In the $n\\times n$ case, cofactor expansion of $\\det(\\bfA-\\lambda\\meye)$ leads to the following definition.\n",

    "````{proof:definition} Characteristic polynomial\n",
    "Suppose $\\bfA$ is $n\\times n$. The {term}`characteristic polynomial` of $\\bfA$ is $\\det(\\bfA-\\lambda\\bI)$. It is of degree $n$ in $\\lambda$, with a leading coefficient of $(-1)^n$.\n",
    "````\n",

    "The roots of the characteristic polynomial are the eigenvalues of the matrix. Given what we know about roots of polynomials, there are some conclusions it's worth stating clearly.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. $\\bfA$ has at least one and at most $n$ distinct complex eigenvalues, and\n",
    "2. If $\\bfA$ is real, then any complex eigenvalues occur in conjugate pairs, as do their associated eigenvectors.\n",

    "We can factor a characteristic polynomial $p$ to get\n",

    "for nonnegative integer exponents such that $m_1+\\cdots+m_k=n$. These exponents are the multiplicities of the roots, and that idea carries to the eigenvalues as well.\n",

    "````{proof:definition} Algebraic multiplicity\n",
    "The {term}`algebraic multiplicity` of an eigenvalue is its multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial.\n",

    "But eigenvalues have another significant notion of multiplicity as well.\n",

    "The {term}`geometric multiplicity` of an eigenvalue is the number of basis vectors in its associated eigenspace.\n",

    "\n",
    "````{proof:definition} Defectiveness\n",
    "An eigenvalue $\\lambda$ whose geometric multiplicity is strictly less than its algebraic multiplicity is said to be {term}`defective`. A matrix is called defective if any of its eigenvalues are defective.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Since multiplicities are always at least one, there is a simple and common case in which we are certain that there are no defective eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{proof:theorem} Distinct eigenvalues imply nondefectiveness\n",
    "If $\\bfA\\in\\cmn{n}{n}$ has $n$ distinct eigenvalues, then $\\bfA$ is not defective.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "For $n=2$, either there is a double eigenvalue or two distinct eigenvalues. Only the case with a double eigenvalue may be defective. Here are the two canonical archetypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{proof:example}\n",
    "If $\\bfA=\\twomat{c}{0}{0}{c}$, then the characteristic polynomial is $p(\\lambda)=(\\lambda-c)^2$. Thus $\\lambda=c$ is the only eigenvalue, with algebraic multiplicity 2. All nonzero vectors are eigenvectors, so we can represent the eigenspace as a linear combination of $\\twovec{1}{0}$ and $\\twovec{0}{1}$. Hence the geometric multiplicity is also equal to 2, and $\\bfA$ is nondefective.\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "````{proof:example}\n",
    "A [previous example](example-linalg-defective) showed that the matrix $\\bfA=\\twomat{4}{1}{0}{4}$ has eigenvalue $\\lambda=4$ with algebraic multiplicity equal to 2 and geometric multiplicity equal to 1. Hence this matrix is defective.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation for $n>2$ can be more complicated, but we will stop here and move on to dynamics."
