    "The $2\\times 2$ identity matrix $\\meye$ has a lone eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$ of algebraic multiplicity 2. The system $(\\meye - \\meye)\\bfv=\\bfzero$ has an RREF that is the zero matrix, so there are two free variables and two basis vectors. Hence the geometric multiplicity of $\\lambda_1$ is also 2.\n",

    "An eigenvalue $\\lambda$ whose geometric multiplicity is strictly less than its algebraic multiplicity is said to be {term}`defective`. A matrix is called defective if any of its eigenvalues are defective.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see later on, defective matrices often complicate the application of eigenvalue analysis. They are rare in the sense that a random matrix has zero probability of being defective, but they do play a role. Since multiplicities are always at least one, there is a simple and common case in which we are certain that a matrix is not defective.\n",

    "````{proof:theorem} Distinct eigenvalues\n",
    "If $\\bfA\\in\\cmn{n}{n}$ has $n$ distinct eigenvalues, then $\\bfA$ is not defective.\n",
