        <title>Shifted cosines</title>
        <p>Here comes a trick we will be relying upon later. The the <term>shifted cosine</term> function
        <men xml:id="eq-fo-ampphase">f(t)=R\cos(\omega t - \phi)</men>
        has <term>amplitude</term> <m>R</m>, <term>angular frequency</term> <m>\omega</m>, and <term>phase shift</term> <m>\phi</m>. Using Euler's identity, we can think of <m>f</m> as the real part of a complex exponential <m>Re^{i(\omega t-\phi)}</m>. This can be manipulated into
        <me> R e^{-i\phi} e^{i\omega t} = (R\cos \phi - i R \sin \phi) ( \cos \omega t + i \sin \omega t)</me>.
        Upon taking the real part of the product, we conclude
        <me> f(t) = R\cos \phi \cos \omega t + R \sin \phi \sin \omega t</me>.  </p>
  
        <p>What's more, we can run that process in reverse. Suppose we are given some real harmonic signal
        <men xml:id="eq-fo-sincos">g(t) = A \cos \omega t + B \sin  \omega t</men>.
        Now find <m>R</m> and <m>\phi</m> such that <m>A=R\cos \phi</m> and <m>B=R \sin \phi</m>. This is equivalent to converting a Cartesian point <m>(A,B)</m> to polar form <m>(R,\phi)</m>, which is easy-peasy. But now we can say that <m>g</m> is equivalent to <m>f</m> in <xref ref="eq-fo-ampphase"/>.</p>
  
        <p>The bottom line is that we can write a harmonic signal in either the amplitude/phase form <xref ref="eq-fo-ampphase"/> or the sin/cos form <xref ref="eq-fo-sincos"/>. They are completely equivalent, and we can use whichever one is more convenient at a particular moment.</p>

      <subsection xml:id="frc-forcing">
        <title>Forcing with a complex exponential</title>
  
        <p>
          Let's say we want to solve <m>y'=ay + \cos(\omega t)</m>. We can recognize the forcing signal as the real part of <m>e^{i\omega t}</m>. Since we solved this problem with exponential forcing in the last section, we can apply the formula there and then take the real part to get the general solution of the original problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, a modified approach cuts down on the amount of algebra we need to do. We'll use the complex form to find a particular solution of the real problem, then add in the null solution to get a general solution. This is quite straightforward. To make <m>y=Ye^{i\omega t}</m> a particular solution with forcing <m>q=e^{i\omega t}</m>, we need only require that
          <me>
            i\omega Y e^{i\omega t} = a Ye^{i\omega t} + e^{i\omega t} \quad \Rightarrow
            \quad Y = \frac{1}{i\omega - a}
          </me>.
          That is, the particular solution is just <m>\frac{1}{i\omega - a}</m> times the forcing signal. If we express <m>Y</m>> in polar form,
          Let's express this multiplicative factor in polar form:
          <me>
           \frac{1}{i\omega - a} = G e^{-i\alpha}
         </me>,
          then a particular solution is
          <me> 
            y_p(t) = G e^{-i\alpha} q(t) = G e^{i(\omega t - \alpha)}
          </me>.    
          On taking the real part of this, we obtain <m>y_p=G \cos(\omega t - \alpha)</m> as a particular solution when <m>q=\cos(\omega t)</m>. We call the real values <m>G</m> and <m>\alpha</m> the <term>gain</term> and <term>phase lag</term>, respectively.
        </p>
  
        <p> 
          Now suppose we generalize a bit to <m>q=A \cos(\omega t) + B\sin(\omega t)</m>. We know that this is equivalent to <m>q=R \cos(\omega t-\phi)</m>, which is the real part of a complex exponential. Following the exact same trail as before, we still find that <m>y_p(t) = G e^{-i\alpha} q(t)</m> is a particular solution and want to take the real part. There are two ways to go here. 
          <ol>
            <li>If <m>q</m> is used in shifted cosine form, then a real particular solution is <m>y_p=GR \cos(\omega t-\phi-\alpha)</m>.</li>
            <li>If <m>q=A \cos(\omega t) + B\sin(\omega t)</m> and you don't want to recast it into shifted cosine form, you get a messier equivalent result:
            <me>
              y_p = (G \cos \alpha)[ A \cos(\omega t) + B\sin(\omega t) ] + (G \sin \alpha)[ A \sin(\omega t) - B\cos (\omega t)]
            </me>.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose we are given the purely real problem <m>y'+y = 2 \sin(t) - 2 \cos(t)</m>. The tedious details of deriving the solution can hide the fact that the essence of the matter is quite simple. A plot of some solutions tells the story.

          The forcing function is, as we now know, a shifted cosine (the thick black curve). You can see that after a short initial stage, the solution always settles into a single shifted cosine at the same frequency but with a different phase and amplitude, as determined by the lag and gain. To wit, for an input at frequency <m>\omega</m>,
            <me>G e^{-i\alpha} = \frac{1}{i\omega  + 1}</me>. 
          Here we have <m>\omega=1</m>, and thus 
            <me>G e^{-i\alpha} = \frac{1}{i  + 1} = \frac{1}{i + 1}\cdot \frac{-i+1}{-i + 1} = \frac{1-i}{2}</me>. 
          The cartesian point <m>(1/2,-1/2)</m> is easy to put into polar form, and we find <m>G=1/\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>\alpha=\pi/4</m>. That is, the particular solution has 70% of the amplitude and lags the driving force by one-eighth of a cycle, as observed in the plot above. 
        </p> 
        <p>
          As for the solution details? The elegant route is to note that the point <m>(-2,2)</m> has polar coordinates <m>R=2\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>-\phi=\pi/4</m>, so that 
          <me>
            q(t) = 2\sqrt{2} \cos\left(t + \frac{\pi}{4} \right)
          </me>. 
          Then a particular solution is 
          <me>
            y_p = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(2\sqrt{2}\right) \cos\left(t + \pi/4 - \pi/4\right) = 2\cos(t)
          </me>, 
          and the general solution is <m>y=C e^{-t} + 2\cos(t)</m>. The initial condition determines <m>C</m>, but the solution always trends towards our <m>y_p</m>. 
          </p>
        </example>
  
        <p>
          Naturally, if the null solution <m>Ce^{at}</m> has exponential growth because <m>a \gt 0</m>, the particular solution quickly becomes insignificant as <m>t</m> marches forward. In the case of decay, though, we always find that it's the initial value that becomes irrelevant, as in the example above, and the effect of the ODE is to change the amplitude and phase of the input.

			Continuing the underdamped case, the gain works out to be
			<me>G^2 = \frac{1}{(\omega_n^2-\omega^2)^2 + 4\omega_n^2Z^2\omega^2}  = \frac{\omega_n^{-4}}{(1-\rho^2)^2 + 4Z^2\rho^2}</me>,
			  where <m>\rho=\omega/\omega_n</m> is a dimensionless frequency ratio. If also <m>Z^2\lt 1/2</m>, the gain is maximized when <m>\rho=\sqrt{1-2Z^2} \lt 1</m>. The gain at that maximum is proportional to <m>1/Z</m>, so much growth in the response is possible near the natural frequency when damping is small in the sense of <m>Z\approx 0</m>. This can be considered a practical resonance for lightly damped systems. 
		  </p>
  
		<example>
		  <p>The oscillator <m>4y'' + y' + 36y</m> from an earlier example has <m>\omega_n=3</m> and <m>Z=1/\sqrt{16\cdot 36}=1/24</m>. Accordingly, gain is maximized when <m>\omega/\omega_n=1-\frac{1}{288}\approx 0.9965</m>, so for practical purposes a resonance occurs at just slightly less than the natural, undamped frequency.
