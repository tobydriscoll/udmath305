<p>The logistic equation is our first real look at a nonlinear ODE. We'll begin with the steady states. We have \(f(y)=y(a-by)\) with roots \(y=0\) and \(y=a/b\text{.}\) Since \(f'(y)=a-2by\text{,}\) we have that the former steady state is unstable and the latter is stable. The stable equilibrium value \(K=a/b\) is important and known as the <dfn class="terminology">carrying capacity</dfn> of the environment. We will find later that this value is the long-term fate of the system for any positive initial condition.</p>
