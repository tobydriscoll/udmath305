    "Let's focus on the linear system $\\bfA\\bfx=\\bfb$ for an $n\\times n$ coefficient matrix $\\bfA$. If $\\bfA$ is invertible, then $\\bfx=\\bfA^{-1}\\bfb$ is the unique solution. What about when $\\bfA$ is singular? All we know at the moment is that there are no solutions, or infinitely many of them.\n",

    "## Homogeneous systems\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that the linear system is {term}`homogeneous` if $\\bfb=\\bfzero$, that is, the system is $\\bfA\\bfx = \\bfzero$. Here is one of those old habits you must learn to break.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "A homogeneous system $\\bfA\\bfx = \\bfzero$ can have nonzero solutions for $\\bfx$, even if $\\bfA$ is not the zero matrix.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, nonzero homogeneous solutions can occur only when $\\bfA$ is singular, because otherwise the solution $\\bfx=\\bfA^{-1}\\bfzero=\\bfzero$ is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice feature of zero is that adding multiples of zero to it is still zero. So, if $\\mathbf{R}$ is the RREF of $\\bfA$, then the RREF of the augmented matrix $[\\bfA;\\,\\bfzero]$ is just $[\\mathbf{R};\\,\\bfzero]$. Each free column of $\\mathbf{R}$ therefore introduces a free variable in the homogeneous solution.\n",

    "Now, let's consider the nonhomogeneous system $\\bfA\\bfx=\\bfb$. We introduce here one of the simplest yet most confusing terms in the course. A {term}`particular solution` of the linear system $\\bfA\\bfx=\\bfb$ is just any one solution of the problem. The only reason the term exists is to distinguish it from the *general* solution, which (as above) is an expression for *every possible* solution of the system.\n",
