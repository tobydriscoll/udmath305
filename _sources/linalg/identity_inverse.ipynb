    "# Identity and inverse\n",
    "\n",
    "You solve $ax=b$ for nonzero $a$ without thinking about it: $x=b/a$. If we do break it down a little, we can see that when we multiply both sides of $ax=b$ by the number $1/a$, then on the left the terms $1/a$ and $a$ combine to give $1$, and $1x=x$. That is, the key to the solution is the presence of a *multiplicative identity* value $1$, and the existence of the *multiplicative inverse* $1/a$ when $a\\neq 0$. These two items are the key to unlocking the vector case $\\bfA\\bfx=\\bfb$, too.\n",
