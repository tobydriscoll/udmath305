### Official site

The official home course site is the one in Canvas. You are responsible for all information and announcements posted there. 

### Contact info

The preferred first step in making contact is to make a new post on
[Piazza](http://piazza.com/udel/spring2019/19smath305/home). If you
email me a question whose answer might matter to other students in the
class, I will probably ask you to post the question there
anyway.

#### Required 
*Differential Equations and Linear Algebra*, by G. S. Strang.

    "on-ramp" tutorial
-   [Introduction to the Live
    Editor](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/using-the-live-editor-117940.html)

    MATLAB)](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/courseware/learn-differential-equations.html),
    videos co-created by the textbook author and the creator of MATLAB
    (note: they have a lot of content we don't need or cover)

    sophisticated discussion of ODEs, but at a reasonable undergraduate
    level

### Deadlines

Unless you are granted a personal exemption by me in advance due to
extenuating circumstances, deadlines are final. Late work will not be
accepted. 

### Homework

You will have 6 homework assignments, roughly biweekly. **Submission
through Canvas as PDF is required.** If you write out homework problems
on paper, use an app such as
[Scanbot](https://scanbot.io/en/index.html), Office Lens, or Dropbox to
convert these pages to PDF and upload them. Alternatively, you can do
your homework in Microsoft Word, which has an acceptable math editor, or
learn to use a [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) editor such
as [TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/) or
[TeXworks](http://www.tug.org/texworks/) to typeset math on a computer
like a boss. 

### MATLAB

MATLAB is a required part of the course. You may choose to purchase the
[student
version](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/student_version.html). For
this course, Simulink and the other parts of the more expensive student
"suite" are not required nor used. MATLAB is also available at the CoE
and Smith Hall computing labs.

You will have 5 MATLAB assignments, roughly biweekly. **Submission
through the MATLAB Grader site is required. **This process will be
demonstrated in class.** 

### Clicker

Use of an [iclicker](https://www.iclicker.com/students) is required for
this course. You may either use a "dumb" clicker available from the
bookstore, or subscribe to the app/web version (variously called "Reef"
or "Cloud" on their website). Be prepared to use whichever solution you
choose in every class period.

To receive credit, you must either register your "dumb" clicker in
Canvas if you have never done so, or [sign up online and register this
course](https://macmillan.force.com/iclicker/s/article/iClicker-Cloud-Student-Registration-Overview)
in your iclicker account. Let me know ASAP if anything is not going
smoothly.

Be advised that in keeping with [UD’s Code
of Conduct](http://www1.udel.edu/stuguide/17-18/code.html),
fraudulent clicker use is considered academic dishonesty and will be
treated as such.

### Participation

Most class periods will have at least two clicker questions for you to
answer in a short time period. **It is a violation of academic honesty
to use another person's clicker, or to have someone use your clicker for
you.** You will receive 1 participation point for each correct answer,
and 1 point for attendance in each class (also measured using clickers).

If you need an *excused* absence for a particular class, contact me
**within 3 working days** of the missed class. In many cases,
documentation will be required. Any excused absences will not be counted
toward your final participation score. 

Suppose you get *x* clicker points during the semester, and *y* is the
maximum possible clicker score based on all unexcused class periods.
Your participation score (fraction of credit awarded) will be min {x/(0.75y),1}.
(This value will not be updated continuously in Canvas, only the raw
scores.)

### Exams

|Exam | Date | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Midterm 1              | March 22, 5:00-7:00 PM      | Smith 120|
| Midterm 2              | April 26, 5:00-7:00 PM     | Smith 120 |
| Final (comprehensive)  | TBA                         | TBA |
  

If an absence for an exam is unexcused, you will receive a zero for that
exam. The university has a [detailed policy](http://facultyhandbook.udel.edu/handbook/3113-student-class-attendance-and-excused-absences)
on what constitutes an excused absence. In most cases, documentation is
required. If you determine that you will not be able to attend an exam,
contact me as soon as possible for instructions. 

### Grading

Your score in the course will be computed as follows:

|Assessment | Part of total score |
|----------------------------------------| :-----: |
|  Homework assignments (6)       |          15% |
|  MATLAB projects (6)         |            10% |
 | Participation (clickers)  | 5% |
 |  Midterm exams (2)         |               40% |
 | Final exam (comprehensive)    |           30% |

The usual 90/80/70/60 scale will be a starting point for letter grades,
but these numbers may be lowered at the discretion of the instructors. 

### Student conduct

#### Academic integrity

Familiarize yourself with UD's [policy on academic
honesty](http://www1.udel.edu/stuguide/17-18/code.html#honesty) and [your
rights](http://www1.udel.edu/stuguide/17-18/conduct.html#undergrad).
Completing work for others is as serious a violation as passing off
someone else's work as your own. Violations may be referred to the
Office of Student Conduct and be subject to
[sanctions](http://www1.udel.edu/stuguide/17-18/sanctions.html#honesty).

#### Sexual misconduct

UD is committed to providing a safe campus environment. If I become
aware of any sexual misconduct by a student, I am required to report it
to the university's Title IX Coordinator. For information on policies
and helpful resources, visit the [UD page on sexual
misconduct](http://www.udel.edu/sexualmisconduct).
