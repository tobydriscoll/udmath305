<p>Let's close this section with a broadening observation. If we consider just \(y''+\lambda y=0\) alone without any boundaries at all, then the solutions are combinations of \(\exp(i\sqrt{\lambda} x)\) and \(\exp(-i\sqrt{\lambda} x)\text{.}\) Potentially every number is an eigenvalue! But it's when we start adding conditions that the possibilities get narrowed. For instance, if we want the eigenfunctions to be bounded as \(x\to\pm\infty\text{,}\) then we must demand that \(\lambda \gt 0\text{,}\) so that the exponents are pure imaginary. Thus the eigenfunctions are \(e^{\pm i\omega x}\) for real \(\omega\text{.}\) If we also want them to be \(2\pi\)-periodic, then we must also require that \(\omega=k\text{,}\) a positive integer. Then the eigenfunctions are our orthogonal friends, \(e^{\pm i k x}\text{.}\) Finally, if we want to force them to be zero at two specific points, the "two-dimensional" combination possibilities collapse down to only \(e^{ikx}-e^{-ikx}\text{,}\) or \(\sin(kx)\text{.}\) The differential operator \(L[y]=y''\) suggests a universe of possible eigenfunctions, but the extra conditions from the boundaries cut down the options.</p>
