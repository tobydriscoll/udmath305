<p>Imagine a long, narrow subway car. All the seats are taken, and some people are standing in the aisle. Then at a stop, a lot of new people come into the car through several door locations. Immediately the areas near the doors become packed with people. The people at the fringes of these knots move away from them and into less densely packed space, and the people behind them follow suit. Ideally, eventually the aisle ends up more or less uniformly dense everywhere.</p>
