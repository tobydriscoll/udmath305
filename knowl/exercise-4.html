<p>A more sophisticated model for the cooling of coffee in a well-insulated mug is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
z' = -rSz,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(z(t)\) is the difference between the coffee temperature and the room temperature, \(S\) is the exposed surface area of the coffee, and \(r\) is a positive rate constant. Thus, a wider mug that exposes more surface area will cause the coffee to cool faster.</p>
<p>Suppose Fred and Wilma each pour out a mug of coffee that is at 85 degrees C. Wilma's mug has a diameter that is \(\sqrt{2}\) times as large as Fred's. Both mugs are left sitting out for 30 minutes in a room that is at 25\({}^\circ\) C, at which point Fred's coffee is at 60 degrees. What is the temperature of Wilma's coffee at the same moment?</p>
