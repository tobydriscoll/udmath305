<p>The partial sums are \(2\pi\) periodic, so they are approximating not \(f\) everywhere but a "sawtooth" variation: first \(f\) is extended oddly to \([-\pi,0]\text{,}\) then the result is repeated periodically over and over to make the sawtooth. Note also that the partial sums are zero at \(x=\pm \pi\text{,}\) because that is the average of the values of (extended) \(f\) at those two points. In effect, \(f\) is "supposed to be" periodic, and the Fourier series can't adjust for the fact that it is not.</p>
