<body><article class="example example-like"><p>In <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-nonlinear-growth.html" title="Example 2.1.8: Nonlinear growth">ExampleÂ 2.1.8</a> it was brought up that the ODE \(x'=x^2\) has solutions that blow up at a finite time. In fact, the solution with \(x(0)=x_0\) is \(x(t)=x_0/(1-x_0t)\text{,}\) which is infinite at \(t=1/x_0\text{.}\) By contrast, linear problems are guaranteed to have solutions wherever their coefficient and forcing functions are continuous.</p></article></body>
