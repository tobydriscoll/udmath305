<p>Numerical solutions are the most universally available methods. They are a form of approximation, though for routine practical applications they can usually be much more accurate than other sources of error or uncertainty would allow. There are circumstances, however, such as very long times or chaotic systems, in which there is some subtlety to the interpretation of numerical results.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="nl-sec-overview.html#li-77">in-context</a></span>
