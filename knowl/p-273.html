<p>The drawback to Laplace transforms as a one-stop solver is that either we include the initial conditions from the start, which forces us to do more partial fraction decompositions, or else the particular solution we find is always the "very particular" one that includes some terms from the null solution. Mathematically, the poles of \(Y(s)\) include those of the transfer function <em class="emphasis">and</em> the forcing function. It's extra algebra to find the coefficients of the null parts, but they affect the coefficients we are interested in. Undetermined coefficients is a less sexy but simpler way to solve concrete problems in many cases.</p>
