<p>By itself this is nice, but what makes this theorem important is that <em class="emphasis">every</em> homogeneous solution can obtained this way. There is some geometric intuition in three dimensions. Each row of \(\bA\bx=\bzero\) is a plane through the origin. Typically three planes intersect at a single point (unique solution), but if two planes coincide, the intersection is a straight line through the origin. We can express such a line as the set of all possible \(c_1\bx_1\) for any vector \(\bx_1\) parallel to the line. Furthermore, if all three planes coincide, then the solution is just the common plane, which can be expressed as the set of alll possible \(c_1\bx_1+c_2\bx_2\) for any two nonparallel vectors in that plane.</p>
