<p>A well-circulated lake contains 1000 kL of water that is initially at a concentration of 2 kg/kL of a pollutant.  Water from the effluent of a factory enters the lake at the rate of 5 kL/h with a concentration of 7 kg/kL of the pollutant.  Polluted water flows out of the lake through an outlet at the rate of 2 kL/h.  Determine the amount of pollutant in the lake as a function of time. (Ignore the fact that the lake may eventually overflow, as we are interested in a relatively short time.)</p>
