<p>Suppose \(s_1=s_2\) is a double root of <a knowl="./knowl/eq-so-char.html" title="Equation 2.3.1">(2.3.1)</a>. This happens when \(B^2=4AC\text{,}\) and \(s_1=-B/(2A)\text{.}\) In this case our candidate for the general solution is inadequate, because we can add the two terms together and having \(c_1+c_2\) is no more general than having a single integration constant. Somehow we have to come up with a genuinely different second solution. It turns out that the job is done by \(te^{s_1t}\text{.}\) The proof is just a bunch of algebra: plug it in and show that it works. So in the double-root case our null solution is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y = c_1 e^{s_1t} + c_2 t e^{s_1t}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Honestly, this is the only unusual thing that happens in this entire section. Everything else is just exploring the consequences of the solutions, and naming the things that we find out.</p>
