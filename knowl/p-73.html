<p>Now, slogging through these formulas may not feel like a revelation. But if you tried to find a particular solution for just a cosine or sine forcing term, you'd find that the result has to have both the sine and cosine in general, and the total amount of ugly algebra is basically conserved. In truth, the complex form is the more fundamental one. Writing the ratio of forcing and solution in <a knowl="./knowl/ex-fl-complex.html" title="Example 1.5.1">ExampleÂ 1.5.1</a> as \(e^{-i\pi/4}/\sqrt{2}\) instantly reveals how the amplitude is reduced and the phase is shifted. Insisting on writing the forcing and solution in real form just obfuscates those simple observations.</p>
