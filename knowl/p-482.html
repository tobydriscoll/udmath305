<p>Each partial (i.e., truncated) sum of the Fourier series is a continuous function that is periodic over \([-\pi,\pi]\text{,}\) and its limit has the same property. It does the best we could hope for, getting the correct value at every point of continuity and "splitting the difference" at the jumps. These jumps include a lack of periodicity in the original \(f\text{.}\) It might help to think of a Fourier series as being defined on a circle with angle \(\theta \in [-\pi,pi]\text{,}\) rather than a regular interval. No point on the circle is truly distinguished; we just choose to cut it somewhere in order to unroll it onto a line.</p>
