<p>The conclusion is that if we measure time as multiples of the characteristic time \(1/a\text{,}\) then the equation has no remaining coefficient in it. That simplifies the analysis and formulas we derive in terms of the new variables, though of course if we go back to the original variables we must get the same result as before. It may not be clear here that this transformation is worth the bother. But later we will have an equation with several dimensional coefficients, and reducing their number makes that equation a lot easier to talk about.</p>
