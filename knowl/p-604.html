<p>We begin with the steady states, which from <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-logistic.html" title="Equation 5.3.1">(5.3.1)</a> are clearly \(x=0\) and \(x=K\text{.}\) Since \(f'(x)=a-(2ax/K)\text{,}\) we conclude that the former steady state is unstable and the latter is stable. That is, the system has a tendency to hover near the carrying capacity. (Later we will show much more: this value is the long-term fate of the system for any positive initial condition.)</p>
