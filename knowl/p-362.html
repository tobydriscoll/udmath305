<p>To refer to a specific element of a matrix, I use the uppercase name of the matrix <em class="emphasis">without</em> boldface, as in \(A_{24}\) to mean the \((2,4)\) element of \(\bA\text{.}\) (This is not universal practice, but it is most like MATLAB.) To refer to an element of a vector, I use just one subscript, as in \(x_3\text{.}\) If you see a boldface character with one or more subscripts, then you know that it is a matrix or vector that belongs to a numbered collection. We sometimes find it useful to refer to the individual columns of a matrix as vectors. My convention is to use a lowercase bold version of the matrix name, with a subscript to represent the column number. Thus, \(\bA_1,\bA_2,\ldots,\bA_n\) are the columns of the \(m\times n\) matrix \(\bA\text{.}\)</p>
