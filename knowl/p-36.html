<p>We can dissect this expression in some detail. The null solution \(e^{at}y(0)\) is by itself a solution to \(y'=ay\text{.}\) The particular solution represented by the integral is new. Think of the integral as a sum over all the moments \(s\lt t\text{.}\) At every such moment there is an input to \(y'\) of size \(q(s)\text{.}\) That little input evolves all on its own for the remaining time \(t-s\) according to \(e^{a(t-s)}q(s)\text{.}\) So it's equivalent to having started a problem with initial value \(q(s)\) at that moment.</p>
