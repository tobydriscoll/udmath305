<p>Although we have only examined two two-dimensional cases, they contain most of what we will see in general. A system of \(n\) linear equations in \(n\) variables with a particular matrix \(\bA\) will either have a unique solution for every choice of \(\bb\text{,}\) or it will have the possibility of no solution or infinitely many solutions depending on \(\bb\text{.}\) In the latter case we say the matrix \(\bA\) is <dfn class="terminology">singular</dfn>, and in the former case we say it is <dfn class="terminology">nonsingular</dfn>. (The term "invertible" is a synonym of nonsingular.)</p>
