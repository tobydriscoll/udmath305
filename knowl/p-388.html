<p>It's one thing to say "the inverse exists," and quite another to say "here it is." Finding the inverse of a given matrix is in principle a matter of solving \(n\) linear systems. That's because if we let \(\mathbf{e}_j\) be the \(j\)th column of \(\bI\text{,}\) then according to the columnwise interpretation of \(\bA\bA^{-1}\text{,}\) the solution of \(\bA \bx = \mathbf{e}_j\) is the \(j\)th column of \(\bA^{-1}\text{.}\) There is a well-known algorithm for solving all those systems simultaneously. However, it's beside the point. If our goal is to solve a linear system \(\bA\bx=\bb\text{,}\) then there is little reason to solve \(n\) other systems first to get the inverse! The inverse tends to be much more important theoretically than for practical computation.</p>
