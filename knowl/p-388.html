<p>Unfortunately, it's one thing to say "the inverse exists" and quite another to say "here it is." There is an algorithm for computing one based on elimination for \(n\) simultaneous linear systems. It's not rocket science, but it's also not the sort of thing you want to do a lot of by hand. (And since it's essentially \(n\)-fold elimination, it's a dumb way to solve linear systems in practice.)</p>
