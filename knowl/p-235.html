<p>The units of the derivative \(dx/dt\) are those of \(x\) divided by those of \(t\text{.}\) Let's write these as \(X/T\text{.}\) Additive terms all need to have the same units, so both \(f(t)\) and \(a(t)x\) have those units as well. Consequently \(a\) has units \(1/T\) and has various interpretations when inverted:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>When \(a \lt 0\text{,}\) the time \(\tau=-1/a\) is the <dfn class="terminology">relaxation time</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">characteristic time</dfn>. If there is no forcing, then \(x(\tau)= e^{-1} x(0) \approx 0.37 x(0)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>In radioactivity it's more common to use \(t_h=-\ln(2)/a\text{,}\) which is the <dfn class="terminology">half-life</dfn>. That's because \(\exp(at_h)=1/2\text{,}\) so half of the radioactive isotope is depleted in that much time.</li>
<li>Similarly, in population or another growth situation with \(a \gt 0\text{,}\) the time \(t_D=\ln(2)/a\) is the <dfn class="terminology">doubling time</dfn>. Note that populations and interest don't grow arithmetically, like \(1,2,3,4,\ldots\text{,}\) but geometrically, like \(1,2,4,8,\ldots\text{.}\)</li>
