<p>Not only does this formula streamline the solution process, but it actually says something quite profound about the solution. We can think of \(G(s,t)\) as the evolution in the homogeneous equation of a state from time \(s\) to time \(t\text{,}\) and the full solution combines this evolution of the initial condition with the sum (integral) of evolution of all the forcing at moments from the initial time to \(t\text{.}\) Each instant of forcing acts like a momentary “kick” to the state, and the final state is the combined evolution of all the kicks, plus the contribution due to \(x_0\text{.}\)</p>
