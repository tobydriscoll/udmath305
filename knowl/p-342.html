<p>Imagine holding a broom by two fingers, with the bristles pointing straight down at the floor. You will not have much difficulty keeping the broom in approximately this position for a long time, even if an annoying friend comes by and jostles you a bit. Now imagine holding it inverted, with the bristles pointing toward the ceiling. If you were able to <em class="emphasis">perfectly</em> balance the center of gravity of a symmetric broom above your fingers, then in principle it ought to stay there. But the broom is not perfect, and your arm and fingers can't stay perfectly still. You might keep the broom upright for a few seconds, but it will soon crash to the floor.</p>
