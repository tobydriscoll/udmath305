<p>But physical reasoning also suggests that this conclusion may not completely generalize to using <em class="emphasis">any</em> two values to determine \(c_1\) and \(c_2\text{.}\) For instance, forget the initial conditions and instead consider using \(y(0)=y(7)=0\text{.}\) One obvious possibility is that the pendulum never moves. But you know that you can also tap the bob <em class="emphasis">just</em> right so that it turns around at 3.5 seconds and then comes back to the lowest position at 7 seconds, thereby satisfying both side conditions. If you tap it a bit harder <em class="emphasis">just</em> right, it will go left, right, and then left again to reach the bottom spot again at 7 seconds, providing yet another solution. You see that we can generate infinitely many solutions to this problem!</p>
