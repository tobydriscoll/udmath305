<p>This is our first example featuring a nonlinear expression in the variable \(y\text{.}\) As a rule, nonlinear ODEs are much harder to solve and have less predictable mathematical structure than linear problems. This particular problem isn't so tough, though; you can check that \(y=1/(1-t)\) is a solution. Note that the growth is even faster--literally off the charts as \(t\to 1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>(You might wonder about the validity of any mathematical model that leads to an infinite result in finite time. But in fact this ODE describes the evolution of the slope of the line of sight to an airplane flying straight over you, and when the airplane is directly overhead, the slope is infinite. So while the model becomes mathematically invalid at that moment, it does describe a concrete physical situation.)</p></article></body>
