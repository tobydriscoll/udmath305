<p>We're going to get a little weird now and consider the case \(y'=iy\text{,}\) where \(i^2=-1\text{.}\) As we'll eventually see, this is out of much more than idle curiosity in the long run. In any event, we'll assume that the solution \(y(t)=e^{it}\) just takes on complex values at all times. So we could write it in real and imaginary parts as \(e^{it} = u(t) + iv(t)\text{.}\) But then applying the ODE, we must conclude</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
u'(t) + iv'(t) = i(u(t)+iv(t)) = -v(t) + iu(t)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>having applied \(i^2=-1\text{.}\) Equating real and imaginary parts, we conclude the pair of real equations \(u'=-v\text{,}\) \(v'=u\text{.}\) Perhaps you recognize these as old friends, sine and cosine. That is,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
e^{it} = \cos(t) + i\sin(t)\text{.}\tag{1.2.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p>This is <dfn class="terminology">Euler's identity</dfn>. It reveals one of the big surprises of applied math: exponential functions, when you go in an imaginary direction, become sin/cos oscillations. This is easily illustrated within MATLAB, which handles complex values routinely. Note the use of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">1i</code> to get the imaginary unit.</p>
