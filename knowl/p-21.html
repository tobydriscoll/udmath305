<p>The process demonstrated in the previous two examples is best known as  <dfn class="terminology">Gauss-Jordan elimination</dfn>, though I prefer to call it <dfn class="terminology">row elimination</dfn> (seeing how the basic idea was known at least in China thousands of years before those dudes were born). As seen in the examples, row elimination consists of two phases, one downward and one upward. The goal is to put the augmented matrix into a special form. In the following definition of that form, we use the term  <dfn class="terminology">leading nonzero</dfn> to mean the first (leftmost) entry of a row that is not zero. </p>
