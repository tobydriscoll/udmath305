<p>The tools for nonlinear problems are more numerous yet less comprehensive than for linear problems:</p>
<dl class="description-list">
<dt>Special cases</dt>
<dd><p>There are problem types that allow successful solution strategies. One of these types, <em class="emphasis">separable equations</em>, is likely already familiar to you. Others include <em class="emphasis">exact equations</em> and <em class="emphasis">Ricatti	equations</em>.</p></dd>
<dt>Change of variables</dt>
<dd><p>As with integration, a change of variables (independent or dependent) can transform a system from a puzzle to a solvable equation. Occasionally there are reasons behind trying certain substitutions, but they often seem to appear out of nowhere.</p></dd>
<dt>Approximations</dt>
<dd><p>The most-often used approximation method is <em class="emphasis">linearization</em>, which lets us call on the methods we have discussed to this point. Other situations are large-time and small-parameter approximations, in the domain of <em class="emphasis">asymptotics</em>.</p></dd>
<dt>Qualitative methods</dt>
<dd><p>Even if it is not possible to write out a solution formula, there are techniques from topology, geometry,  and other areas of mathematics that allow us to deduce some specific major properties of the solutions. A notable example is <em class="emphasis">bifurcation analysis</em>, which studies the effects of a key parameter.</p></dd>
<dt>Numerical solutions</dt>
<dd><p>Numerical solutions are the most universally available methods. They are a form of approximation, though for routine practical applications they can usually be much more accurate than other sources of error or uncertainty would allow. There are circumstances, however, such as very long times or chaotic systems, in which there is some subtlety to the interpretation of numerical results.</p></dd>
