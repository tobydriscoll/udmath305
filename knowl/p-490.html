<p>Let's return to the world of the second-order oscillator, \(y''+y=f(t)\text{.}\) We know the general solution to this problem has two arbitrary constants in it,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y(t) = c_1 \cos(t) + c_2 \sin(t) + y_p(t)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In some examples we found specific values for \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) as determined by the additional requirements \(y(0)=\alpha\) and \(y'(0)=\beta\text{.}\) We never stopped to ask whether this was always feasible. But note that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\alpha \amp = y(0) = c_1 + y_p(0)\\
\beta \amp = y'(0) = c_2 + y_p'(0)\text{,}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>so there is no difficulty. In most linear problems (those without a repeated root) we would have the general solution \(c_1 e^{s_1 t} + c_2 e^{s_2 t} + y_p(t)\text{,}\) and then the initial conditions imply</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\alpha \amp = y(0) = c_1 + c_2 + y_p(0)\\
\beta \amp = y'(0) = s_1 c_1 + s_2 c_2 + y_p'(0)\text{,}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>which is a linear system with coefficient matrix \(\twomat{1}{1}{s_1}{s_2}\text{.}\) This matrix is nonsingular as long as \(s_1\neq s_2\text{,}\) so again we know there will be unique choices for \(c_1\) and \(c_2\text{.}\) (For a repeated root the general solution changes, but we end up at the same conclusion. In fact, this is exactly why having a nonzero Wronskian was important a while ago.)</p>
