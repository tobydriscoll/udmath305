<p>A <dfn class="terminology">differential equation</dfn> is an equation that has some derivatives in it. (Duh.) The variable whose derivative is taken is called the <dfn class="terminology">dependent variable</dfn> and is considered the "unknown" of the differential equation. We'll be concerned with the case where there is only one <dfn class="terminology">independent variable</dfn>  (a "with respect to" variable in the denominator of a derivative), so there are no partial derivatives and we say the equation is  an <dfn class="terminology">ordinary differential equation</dfn>, or ODE. For discussions and theory we will stick to \(x\) and \(t\) as the dependent and independent variables, but in general these are determined by what is being modeled by the ODE.</p>
