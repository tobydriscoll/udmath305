<p>The simplest nontrivial ODE of all is \(y'=ay\text{,}\) where \(a\) is a constant. It takes no effort at all to verify that \(y(t)=e^{at}\) is a solution, as we have seen a couple of times already. One way to view the role of \(a\) is to switch between growth (positive values),  decay (negative values), and stasis (zero). But you can also interpret it as a rescaling of the time measurement. For instance, if we change from measuring time in minutes to measuring it in seconds, it's equivalent to multiplying \(a\) by 60. One consequence is that exponential decay is just like running a movie of exponential growth in reverse.</p>
