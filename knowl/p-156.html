<p>A quick word about words. In math we typically use the term frequency to mean an <dfn class="terminology">angular frequency</dfn>, as with the value \(\omega_n\) that multiplies \(t\) inside the trig functions. You can think of this value as meaning "radians per second." In engineering and physics one might be more comfortable using "cycles per second" (or Hertz), which leads to a different value of frequency, \(\omega_n/2\pi\text{.}\) We won't be using that, just to avoid confusion, but now you're aware that corresponding formulas in other sources might have extra factors of \(2\pi\) sprinkled about.</p>
