<p>Suppose Fred and Wilma each pour out a mug of coffee that is at 85 degrees C. Wilma's mug has a diameter that is \(\sqrt{2}\) times as large as Fred's. Both mugs are left sitting out for 30 minutes in a room that is at 25\({}^\circ\) C, at which point Fred's coffee is at 60 degrees. What is the temperature of Wilma's coffee at the same moment?</p>
