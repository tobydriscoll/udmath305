<p>Consider a simple pill of antihistamine taken by a person.  The pill goes to the GI tract where it dissolves and the antihistamine diffuses through to the bloodstream (BS), and it is then eliminated by chemical reactions or through the kidneys. Let \(x(t)\)  and \(y(t)\) be the concentrations of the drug in the GI tract and the bloodstream, respectively.  Assume the rate of clearance from each compartment is proportional to the drug concentration in that compartment.  Formulate an IVP for the two concentrations.  Assuming the initial concentrations are \(x(0)=A\) and \(y(0)=0\text{,}\) solve the IVPs.</p>
